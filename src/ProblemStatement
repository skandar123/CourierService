Delivery Cost Estimation
========================
There are N no.of vehicles and have driver partners to drive each vehicle and deliver packages.
Only one offer code can be applied for any given package.
Package should meet the required mentioned offer criterias.
If offer code is not valid/found, discounted amount will be equal to 0.
For offer code OFR001, 10% discount if distance is less than 200 and weight is between 70 and 200.
For offer code OFR002, 7% discount if distance is between 50 and 150 and weight is between 100 and 250.
For offer code OFR003, 5% discount if distance is between 50 and 250 and weight is between 10 and 150.

Delivery Time Estimation
========================
You have to build a courier service to deliver packages.
There are N number of vehicles available for delivering the packages.
Each Vehicle has a limit(L) on maximum weight (kg) that it can carry.
All vehicles travel at the same speed (S km/hr) and in the same route.
It is assumed that all the destinations can be covered in a single route.
The vehicles always travel at max speed and post package deliver, vehicle will return back to the source station with the same speed and will be available for another shipment.
Shipment should contain max packages vehicle can carry in a trip.
We should prefer heavier packages when there are multiple shipments with the same number of packages.
If the weights are also the same, preference should be given to the shipment which can be delivered first.
You are required to build a command line application to calculate the estimated delivery time for every package by maximizing number of packages in every shipment.
